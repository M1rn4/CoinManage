# CoinManage

CoinManage is an all-in-one platform designed to simplify management and payments between freelancers and service clients. Our platform offers an intuitive and efficient ecosystem that provides an exceptional experience for both clients and independent professionals.

## Key Features

- **Project Management**: CoinManage allows clients to submit their requirements and divide them into tasks or deliverables for better tracking and organization.
- **Escrow Wallets**: Payments are made through escrow wallets, where the client's funds are securely held until tasks are executed and accepted.
- **Lean Kanban Board**: CoinManage provides an integrated Kanban board for freelancers to visualize and organize their tasks efficiently.
- **Milestone Payments**: Each task has an assigned percentage that must be deposited once the task is executed and accepted by the client, ensuring greater security for both parties.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: We used React.js and Chakra UI to develop the user interface of CoinManage, providing a modern and responsive experience.
- **Backend**: We implemented the Django framework to handle server logic and data management on the platform.
- **Blockchain**: CoinManage utilizes Mantle Network as a layer 2 solution to ensure secure and efficient blockchain transactions.
